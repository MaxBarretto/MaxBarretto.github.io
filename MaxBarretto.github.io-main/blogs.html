    <p class="text_column">The Street Fighter V player Arturo "NYCFurby" Sanchez was recently released from the E-Sports crowd funding project Matcherino as well as Team Spooky after allegations surfacing of the player "mishandling prize pool funds". The player had been a competitor and tournament organizer in the Street Fighter community for the upwards of 10 years, so the news was certainly shocking to hear. After hearing about the news online, Sanchez posted a reply in which he said that the situation was a "massive misunderstanding" and that the issues were working to be resolved with the release of receipts of the transactions that had ocurred. This article takes a good approach to this topic by only talking about the facts and not taking any bias for or against Sanchez in the drama. </p>

    <p class="text_column">This article takes a look at some of last year's biggest ESports tournaments in terms of prize pool money. The game that had the biggest prize pool for a tournament this year was DOTA 2, with $18.9 million on the line. The change in sheer scale of events since the days of arcades or grassroots gatherings is astounding to see, and as ESports continue, the prize pools will continue to grow. The articl is pretty simple and surface level, since it's just talking about some simple statistics. One interesting thing about this article is thinking that something like Fortnite's $3 million tournaments getting blown out of the water by a 10 year old game. </p>

    <p class="text_column">To be successful, your brand needs to have a wide appeal and a recognizable logo. A complex or simple logo can work, but having a simple design that is easy to draw can really catch the eye. The main thing that you need is a consistant color scheme that people can associate with your brand. For example, IKEA is known for the yellow and blue pallette that is in their logo and both store interior and exterior. To make a new brand, you want a simple design that communicates the image and style of the brand, so stylized acronyms are a great place to start. </p>

    <p class="text_column">Epic Games, the creators of Fortnite, recently announced new events in the Fortnite Champions Series 2023, including a series of large scale competitive events as well as a new Global Championship in Copenhagen later this year. This will be the first time since 2019 that major tournaments will be held in-person, due to the coronavirus outbreak, and Epic Games is making sure these tournaments will be worthwile with a total of $10 million across this year's tournaments. This will mark a major increase in viewership and participation since talk about the game had been going down since the game's peak viewership in 2019. The article is pretty simple to understand, but it does use some tournament jargon that may confuse some readers. The article does give an in-depth description of how the tournaments will work, and it was an overall very informative article.</p>

    <p class="text_column">This article covers some recent changes that were implemented in the most recent update of Warner Brothers' 2D fighting game, Multiversus. The game was released a while back as a free-to-play game, and it was topping the charts on Steam for active player bases for fighting games. This new update means that many players who stopped playing the game may come back to see if their favorite characters got buffed, and some rumors circulating of upcoming characters will generate interest for the game's near future.</p>

    <p class="text_column">This article explains how although E-Sports have been very popular recently, investors are unsure if the "future of entertainment" is a good money maker. With the widespread cultural phenomenon of E-Sports lead by million-dollar tournaments by RIOT Games for League of Legends, and sports stadiums being sold out, investors are thinking that this could be the next NBA or NFL in terms of marketability. What these people think is holding the industry back is time, so eventually the E-Sports industry could be selling out jerseys and other fanbase merchandise. The article is somewhat surface level due to its speculative nature, but is an interesting read and the format of an edited transcript makes the information easy to understand.</p>

    <p class="text_column">This article details how although viewership numbers for fighting game competitions are much lower than other games like League of Legends or Valorant, there is a loyal fanbase that don't get recognition from many E-Sports brands. With the most popular fighting game being Super Smash Bros, a game followed by 14% of hardcore E-Sports fans, it a a wonder that there are not any major prize pools to compete with other games. In fact, Arian Fathieh believes that Smash Bros could be the best investment for a sponsor to choose, and with an upcoming League of Legends fighting game, the sub-genre is sure to garner some attention in the near future. This article is a bit more complex and deep with its approach to its purpose, but gives a strong description of current events for Smash Bros.</p>
        <h2 class="light">&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/epistory-typing-chronicles-445794">1/25: Epistory Impressions</a></h2>
    <p class="text_column">My initial impressions of Epistory are currently quite positive. While the game speed is a bit slow right now, there are upgrades to make the character move faster, which does significantly help with the pacing of the game early on. The visuals of the game are very pleasing, with a unique hand-crafted aesthetic that makes the game feel magical at times. The gameplay so far has been interesting, as the game doesn't seem to have a true narrative progression or end goal, instead being a game about exploration and discovery, which I do quite like.</p>
        <h2 class="light">&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/at-colleges-nationwide-esports-teams-dominated-by-men-154793">1/27: Women in E-Sports</a></h2>
    <p class="text_column">At least at a college level, E-Sports are by all means a male majority sport, and seeing women in competition is rare due to some severe obstacles that need to be tackled in the coming years. Due to factors like harassment, toxic masculinity, and stereotyping, girls are discouraged to play games that they might otherwise win at. No matter who you are, you should be able to have a chance to win at any competition, and once the E-Sports community is more diverse, it will encourage other people to play, growing the overall fanbase and competition.</p>

       	 <h2 class="light">&nbsp; &nbsp;2/6: E-Sports Communication</h2>
    <p class="text_column">E-Sports revolve around good teamwork, and some major aspects of that involve being a good listener, making your intentions clear, have patience, and be flexible to any changes on the fly. Without these skills, even the strongest teams will fail, making individual skills pointless. Some strategies that my teams can incorporate are shieldbreaks in Smash Bros, and sandbagging in Mario Kart to get better items. To improve our communication, we can play some fun friendly games, for example, having two people play blindfolded while the other two instruct how to play. Upon actually trying this excercise, it proved to be exceedingly difficult, but it was also a blast and it helped communicate directions at least a little better.</p>
       	 <h2 class="light">&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/heres-what-itll-take-to-clean-up-esports-toxic-culture-143520">2/8: E-Sports Toxicity</a></h2>
    <p class="text_column">The gaming space has been polluted with overwhelming toxicity in recent years, largely due to the accessibility of microphones with a lack of necessary punishments for saying insults online. When someone starts spreading hate, the ramifications of physical and emotional distress can hurt performance even at the highest level of competition, so the responsibility is on the part of game companies to intervene and block accounts that promote the kind of behaviour that shouldn't be tolerated. Systems like the "Tribunal" system by the League of Legends publishers Riot Games allowed people to vote on whether certain instances of bad behaviour were tolerable, which is a step in the right direction, although the service ended shortly after release.</p>
       	 <h2 class="light">&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/02/esports-around-the-world-australia">2/14: Australia E-Sports</a></h2>
    <p class="text_column">This article gives a spotlight into E-Sports events located in Australia, describing how the government began recognizing video games as legitimate sports, some major teams based in Australia, and education initiatives. Queensland University of Technology actually became the first higher-education institution to offer a degree in E-Sports, indicating a major step toward the expansion of the digital medium for competition.</p>
