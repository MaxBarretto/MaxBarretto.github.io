    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">One of the consoles that really influenced my gaming journey was the Wii, since it was my first game console. I never cared much for the Nintendo handheld devices like the DS and 3DS, but I always remember playing classic games like Lego Star Wars, Mario Kart Wii, Twilight Princess, and Smash Bros Brawl. Also, this console led me to being a Nintendo fan, which helped me meet some of my best friends to this day. </p>
    <p class="text_column">The PS4 was really my first introduction to a graphically powerful console, and I think that it was an important stepping stone to finding a lot of the games I love. Games like Persona 5, Spider-Man PS4, and even more recent games like Ghost of Tsushima, and Final Fantasy 7 Remake showed me beautiful stories and visuals only found on modern hardware. </p>
    <p class="text_column">The game system I think had the most influence on my gaming journey was my PC. There is something special about the satisfaction of building something you have used every day since, and to me, my PC has given me that feeling. Outside of playing video games, I have learned so much about gaming and games from the countless hours of use since I have been using this PC. </p>

      <h2>Super Smash Brothers Brawl&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

      <p>My first game that I saw anyone play was Super Smash Bros. Brawl on the Nintendo Wii. From the second I saw it, I knew I would need to buy the game whenever I got the chance. All the characters looked so cool, and when I eventually play for the first time, I ended up choosing the character that looked the coolest, Meta Knight. After mashing buttons and winning with Meta Knight, something about Smash Bros. clicked in my brain, and ever since then, I have been complaining about all of the games not being well balanced. I do really enjoy all of the games, but I now have the perspective that every game in the series has flaws, and those flaws make the games unique. </p>

      <h2>Minecraft</h2>

      <p>The other game that was as important to me as my first Smash Bros game was Minecraft. I was never actually good at beating the main objective to defeat the Ender Dragon, but I was always fascinated by trying to build cool structures or trying and failing to make redstone contraptions. I think that this game helped build some of my creativity, and I will always enjoy a casual gameplay session whenever I'm bored. </p>

    <p class="parallax_description">I'm already a big fan of Street Fighter 5, so it's only natural that I would be extremely excited for its sequel, SF6. Another Upcoming fighting game is Fraymakers, a crossover game like Smash Bros, although this game is currently in early access. Lastly, I'm waiting for Marvel's Spider Man 2, a sequel to the PS4 game I love so much.</p>
